# Getting Started

First, you will need to install the following:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or your preferred IDE, though, you'll have to find the same plugins for your chosen IDE.)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (for terminal commands)
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (to clone the repository to be able to edit in VSC)


Next, install the following extensions for Visual Studio Code.
- [Rojo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo) (You will need this to build the project)
- [Luau LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.luau-lsp)
- [Stylua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.stylua) (You wil need this to format your scripts)
- [GitHub Issues & Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)
- [TabNine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode) (OPTIONAL, extension that can help with autocompleting.)
- [Rojo Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=filiptibell.rojo-viewer) (OPTIONAL, roblox studio-like explorer view for Rojo.)

Once you have finished installing everything, Open up Github Desktop and clone this repository.

Open the repository in VSC and press F1 on your keyboard and type in "Rojo". 
You will see an option that says ["Rojo: Open Menu"](https://imgur.com/a/nCwNQ3O), Select that option. 
Once you are in the Rojo menu, click [Install Rojo](https://imgur.com/a/wHIT5bO).
(If you're having trouble with this step, create a blank folder and open it in VSC and install Rojo. Once you have installed rojo on that folder, go back to the repository folder and try this step again then continue.)

Open up the repository in a terminal window ([CTRL + SHIFT + ` in VSC](https://imgur.com/a/MDQcRLu), [or right click the folder in Explorer then click "Open in Terminal"](https://imgur.com/a/u1KzvLe))

In the terminal window, type in the following commands:
```bash
aftman install
lune setup
```



You are now done with the Getting Started guide. You can now go back to the [README](./README.md) and build the place.
