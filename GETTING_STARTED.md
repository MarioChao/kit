# Getting Started

First, you will need to install Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE).

Next, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Next, install the following extensions.
- [Rojo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo) (You will need this to build the project)
- [Luau LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.luau-lsp)
- [Stylua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.stylua) (You wil need this to format your scripts)
- [GitHub Issues & Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)
- [TabNine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode) (OPTIONAL, extension that can help with autocompleting.)
- [Rojo Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=filiptibell.rojo-viewer) (OPTIONAL, roblox studio-like explorer view for Rojo.)


Once you have finished installing everything, press F1 on your keyboard and type in "Rojo". 
You will see an option that says "Rojo: Open Menu", Select that option. 
Once you are in the Rojo menu, click Install Rojo.

Open up the repository in a terminal window (CTRL + SHIFT + ` in VSC, or right click the folder in Explorer then click "Open in Terminal")
In the terminal window, type in the following commands:
```bash
aftman install
lune setup
```

You are now done with the Getting Started guide. You can now go back to the [README](./README.md) and build the place.
